The solar system consists of the Sun and the celestial bodies that orbit it, including planets, moons, asteroids, and comets.  

Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, known for its extreme temperature variations.   
   
Venus, often called Earth's twin, is similar in size but has a thick atmosphere that traps heat.   

Earth is the only planet known to support life.				        
 
Mars, the Red Planet, has the largest volcano and canyon in the solar system.	

Jupiter, the giant of the solar system, is known for its Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has lasted for centuries.      

Saturn is famous for its stunning rings, made up of ice and rock particles.	
   
Uranus is unique for its tilt, rotating on its side compared to other planets.   			 

Neptune, the furthest planet from the Sun, is known for its deep blue color and strong winds.  

    	Finally, beyond the planets, there are countless small bodies like asteroids and comets that add to the solar system's diversity.
