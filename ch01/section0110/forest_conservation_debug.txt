Forests in Europe cover around 43% of the continent's land area and play a crucial role in the ecosystem. These diverse forests are vital for carbon sequestration, helping to mitigate climate change impacts. They are home to numerous species, many of which are endangered or threatened due to habitat loss. Conservation efforts across Europe focus on sustainable forest management and protecting biodiversity.

One key initiative is the European Unionâ€™s Natura 2000 network, which aims to safeguard various habitats, including forests. This network includes protected areas where conservation practices help maintain the ecological balance. In addition, many countries have established national parks and reserves dedicated to preserving their unique forest landscapes.
